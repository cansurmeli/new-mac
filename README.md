# New Mac
The things I do when setting up a new Mac.

## Setup shell

- [ ] Install prezto: `./install_prezto.sh`
- [ ] Setup [dotfiles](https://github.com/cansurmeli/dotfiles)
- [ ] `./brewfile.sh`
- [ ] `./caskfile.sh`
- [ ] `./masfile.sh`
- [ ] Login locally to GitHub
- [ ] Transfer `.ssh` folder
- [ ] Transfer `.directories` file
- [ ] Transfer `.functions_confidential` file

> A small tip. Currently, even with a fast internet connection. installing Xcode takes a whole lot of time; especially the installation after the download is really arduous. Therefore, it could be better to grap `Command Line Tools` separately since a lot of various stuff makes use of it and Xcode's installation will hang the process up!
